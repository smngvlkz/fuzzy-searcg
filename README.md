#   Fuzzy Search Component

My best attempt to implement a fuzzy search component using Vue 3 and Typescript within the given 4-hour time frame. It allows users to search for products using a dummy API and displays the results in real time.

# Feaatures

+ Real-time search as you type
+ Debounced API calls to reduce network requests
+ Displaying search results with the product details plus ratings
+ Error handling for failed API requests
+ Selected product display with a clear option

# Technologies Used

+ Vue 3
+ Typescript
+ Vite
+ @vueues/core for utility functions

# API

For product data I used: https://dummyjson.com/products as per the instructions.
